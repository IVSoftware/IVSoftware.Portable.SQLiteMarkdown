This SelfIndexed C# base class can be inherited to manage properties decorated with custom attributes for advanced indexing and search functionality. Here’s a high-level breakdown of its purpose and behavior:

1. **Primary Key Management**:
   - A `PrimaryKey` property checks for the `[PrimaryKey]` attribute on derived class properties.
   - If no property has this attribute, the class throws an exception, ensuring the derived class explicitly specifies a primary key.

2. **Searchable Properties**:
   - Three main properties—`LikeTerm`, `ContainsTerm`, and `TagMatchTerm`—are marked with specific attributes (`[QueryLikeTerm]`, `[FilterLikeTerm]`, `[TagMatchTerm]`). These support different types of search capabilities.
   - Each term is dynamically updated via `ensure` logic that triggers re-indexing only when necessary.

3. **Indexing and Caching**:
   - The `internalExecuteIndexing` method ensures that all terms (`LikeTerm`, `ContainsTerm`, `TagMatchTerm`) stay current based on property values with specified indexing modes.
   - This indexing is optimized with a cache of indexed properties (`indexedProperties`), ensuring only relevant properties contribute to each search term.

4. **Property Change Handling**:
   - The `OnPropertyChanged` method reacts to property changes, and if a property is indexed, it updates the internal dictionary (`internalProperties`) to ensure the changes are reflected in searches.
   - A `WatchdogTimer` delays triggering term updates after property changes. This delay allows for rapid, consecutive property changes to stabilize before consuming resources on re-indexing, which optimizes performance during initialization or batch updates.

5. **Serialization Support**:
   - The `Properties` property serializes `internalProperties` into JSON format, allowing it to be stored or transmitted easily.
   - Conversely, it deserializes JSON data back into `internalProperties`.

6. **Attribute-Based Caching**:
   - Two dictionaries, `indexedProperties` and `persistedProperties`, store properties marked for indexing or persistence.
   - This caching makes future lookups efficient, as it only includes properties with relevant attributes (`SelfIndexedAttribute`).

This class, in short, is a customizable, attribute-driven indexing framework that supports various search terms and delayed property update handling for efficient search-related operations.
